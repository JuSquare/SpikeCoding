# SpikeCoding

This package features MATLAB, Python and ROS implementations of spike encoding and decoding algorithms. So far, the following algorithms are available:
- Population coding:
	- [Matlab][Python][ROS] Gaussian Receptor Fields
	- [Matlab][Python] Boht√© et al. (2002) GRF
- Temporal coding:
	- [Matlab][Python][ROS] Temporal contrast
	- [Matlab][Python][ROS] Step-forward
	- [Matlab][Python][ROS] Moving window
- Rate coding: 
	- [Matlab][Python] Hough spike
	- [Matlab][Python] Threshold Hough
	- [Matlab][Python] Ben's spike

TODOs: 
- Finish integration of rate coding to ROS node
- Add Population schemes to ROS node
- Implement the following schemes: non-linear GRF, ROC, Poisson, LPC.
- Upload review table & add references on README
- Generate tests for MNIST dataset
- Generate tests for IMU data from the Obstacle Detection & Avoidance Dataset
- Setup framework for parameters optimisation (DEAP, PyEvolve, PyBrain)
- Include to PySNN (?)

## 1. MATLAB Implementation

The MATLAB codes are available in *SpikeCodingMatlab*. Within this folder, simply execute the `SpikeCoding.m` file to have an overview of the results (encoding/decoding) of the implemented schemes tested on 3 different functions.

## 2. Python Impmementation

The Python scripts are available in *SpikeCodingPython*. Within this folder, simply execute the `main.py` file to have an overview of the results (encoding/decoding) of the implemented schemes tested on  3 different functions. 

Here you can find the results:

## 3. ROS Package

The ROS folder contains the following packages: 
- *spyke_coding*: creates a ROS node to generate spikes based on input data and the selected coding scheme.
- *spyke_coding_schemes*: includes all the encoding and decoding functions used in the *spyke_coding* package.
- *spyke_msgs*: defines the custom spiking messages to be published.

### Installing

Install ROS Noetic (for Ubuntu Focal 20.04 LTS) using the following tutorial: <br>http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu 

Install *catkin* python tools: 

	sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-tools 
	
Install additionnal dependencies:

	sudo apt install python3-catkin-lint python3-pip
	pip3 install osrf-pycommon==0.1.9
	pip3 install empy

Then create your workspace:

	cd~ 
	mkdir -p catkin_ws/src

Clone this repository, and copy the ROS packages to your `~/catkin_ws/src/` folder. Then compile your project: 

	cd /catkin_ws/
	catkin_make
	source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

### Testing

The *spyke_coding* package includes a set of launch files for each type of encoding. In its present form, the package defines a fake signal with a given sampling period `dt` and a signal duration `T_max` (in seconds). Both temporal and rate coding schemes use a buffer of size `1/dt`. 

Once the ROS node is launched, it automatically stops after `T_max` seconds, or if the user press `ctrl+c`. The output data is stored here: `~/.ros/encoding.bag`

Example on the temporal-contrast encoding: 

	cd /catkin_ws/
	source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
	roslaunch spyke_coding encode_temporal_contrast.launch

After completion, you can plot the results using the dedicated Python script:

	cd <path_to_this_repository>/SpikeCodingPython/
	python process_rosbags.py ~/.ros/encoding.bag

Here is an example result:
